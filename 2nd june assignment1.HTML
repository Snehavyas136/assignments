    <h1>My Favorite Hobby: Photography</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
        Photography is more than just clicking a button — it's a form of <strong>creative expression</strong> that captures moments in time. 
        I developed an interest in photography when I was a teenager, and it has since become a passionate hobby of mine.
        <br><br>
        Whether it's a scenic sunset, a bustling city street, or the quiet look in someone's eyes, I find immense joy in <em>freezing real-life moments</em> and sharing them with others.
    </p>
    <h2>Why I Love Photography</h2>
    <p>
        One of the main reasons I love photography is the sense of freedom and discovery it brings. When I have my camera in hand, 
        I'm constantly looking for beauty in the ordinary. It has helped me to appreciate the small details around me, like the 
        <u>texture of a weathered wall</u> or the symmetry in architectural lines.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        In conclusion, photography enriches my life by allowing me to explore both the world and myself. 
        It's a <strong>creative outlet</strong>, a personal challenge, and a source of joy all rolled into one.
